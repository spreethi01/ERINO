# Contact Management System - Frontend

This is the frontend for the Contact Management System built with **ReactJS** and **Material UI** (MUI). It provides an interface for users to manage their contacts by performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Users can add new contacts, view contact details in a table, edit contact information, and delete contacts.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: ReactJS
- **State Management**: React `useState`, `useEffect`
- **HTTP Requests**: Axios
- **CSS**: Custom CSS for layout and styling

## Features

### 1. Add New Contact
- Users can add new contact details such as First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone Number, Company, and Job Title.

### 2. View Contacts
- Displays contacts in a table with sortable columns.
- Each contact has an **Edit** and **Delete** button for managing contact details.
- Pagination controls are available to browse through the list of contacts.

### 3. Edit Contact
- Users can click the **Edit** button to modify an existing contact's information and save the changes.

### 4. Delete Contact
- Users can delete a contact by clicking the **Delete** button, removing the contact from the system.

### 5. Pagination
- Pagination allows users to navigate through large lists of contacts by limiting the number of records displayed per page.

### 6. Dialog Box for Form Inputs
- A dialog box (modal) is used for adding or editing contact information, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Setup Instructions

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/spreethi01/ERINO.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
    Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set Up the Backend**
    - This frontend application interacts with the backend (API server) running on **`http://localhost:4000`**. Make sure to have the backend running first.
    - If you're using the backend provided earlier, follow the instructions in the backend repository to set up the server and database.

4. **Start the Development Server**
    To start the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you will be able to:
- **Add New Contacts**: Click the `+ Add New Contact` button to open the contact form.
- **View Contacts**: All contacts will be displayed in a table with their basic information. You can click on **Edit** to modify a contact or **Delete** to remove it.
- **Pagination**: Navigate through the list of contacts with the **Previous** and **Next** buttons.

## Pagination & Sorting

The contact list is displayed with pagination and sorting:
- **Pagination**: The table fetches a limited number of contacts (e.g., 10 per page) to avoid overwhelming the user with too many records at once. You can switch pages using the **Previous** and **Next** buttons at the bottom of the table.
- **Sorting**: The table columns are sortable. Users can click on a column header to sort contacts by that attribute.

## Components

### 1. **App.js**
- This is the main entry point of the app where all states and logic are managed. It controls the data fetching, pagination, and handles CRUD operations using Axios.

### 2. **DialogBox.js**
- A modal dialog that opens when adding or editing a contact. This component is responsible for showing the contact form, validating inputs, and submitting data.

### 3. **Contact Table**
- Displays a list of contacts with sorting options. Each row contains a contactâ€™s basic information and action buttons for editing and deleting contacts.

## Error Handling

- **API Failures**: If any API call (e.g., fetching contacts, adding, editing, or deleting) fails, an error message will be logged to the console, and an alert will notify the user of the failure.
- **Empty Table**: If no contacts are found, a message is displayed: "No contacts found".
